    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve always been a problem solver—first with computers, then with customers, and now through
      code. My journey into tech didn’t start in a classroom. It started when I was 12, building my
      first PC with help from a friend. What began as a way to play games turned into something
      bigger: I was theming Myspace profiles, exploring open-source tools like Foobar2000, and
      accidentally wiping my hard drive while trying to fix it through the command line. That
      moment—panic, recovery, learning—was my first real lesson in how tech works _under_ the
      surface. I didn’t know it then, but I was already on my way. My early career was in retail. I
      sold components and electronics at RadioShack, then moved to Verizon, where I found I was just
      as strong at solving technical issues as I was at making sales. I eventually focused full-time
      on client solutions. At the same time, I was in college studying automotive technology,
      chasing what I thought was my path—until I realized fixing cars felt more like a chore, while
      working with computers felt like home. A turning point came when I was offered a role at a
      civil engineering firm. It wasn’t my field, but I loved the culture and the collaborative
      environment. Around then, a friend introduced me to a coding bootcamp at Rutgers. That’s when
      everything clicked. Web development was the thing I didn’t know I’d been preparing for all
      along. Since then, I’ve worked across multiple teams and companies, constantly leveling up and
      expanding my skill set. What’s kept me grounded throughout is my love for figuring things
      out—whether it’s debugging code, customizing a UI, or helping a teammate understand something
      clearly. Communication has always been my edge, and tech became the space where I could
      combine that with real, creative problem-solving. I'm still learning. Still building. Still
      curious. That hasn’t changed.

    <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
    <p>
      I see myself as early in my career, but not inexperienced. I’ve worked on client-facing
      applications, contributed to real products, and learned how to deliver practical solutions.
      What I’m looking for now is the right environment to sharpen my skills with purpose. In past
      roles, I’ve thrived most when I had strong mentorship—someone to challenge me, give feedback,
      and help me connect the dots between what I know and how to apply it. I experienced this
      firsthand while working at a weather tech company, where thoughtful code reviews, agile
      processes, and a supportive team helped me grow more in a year than I had in several before
      it. That’s the kind of structure I’m seeking again. I’ve also learned the hard way what
      doesn’t work—roles with no direction, no growth, or no room to ask questions. Even in those
      situations, I’ve stayed committed to doing great work, whether that meant learning SQL on my
      own or coming up with creative frontend solutions in a startup setting. Most recently, I’ve
      spent the last four years building client sites in a fully matured CMS platform. I’m proud of
      what I accomplished there, but I’m ready for something more dynamic. I want to build, learn,
      and contribute to something that evolves. Ideally, I’m looking for a team working with modern
      frontend technologies like React or Vue, with space to grow into full-stack development. More
      than anything, I want to be part of a company that values mentorship, collaboration, and
      constant improvement—because that’s where I do my best work.
