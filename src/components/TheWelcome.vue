    <template #heading>What I'm Looking For</template>
    <p>
      I see myself as early in my career, but not inexperienced.
      <ul>
        <li>I’ve worked on client-facing applications</li>
        <li>Contributed to real products</li>
        <li>Learned how to deliver practical solutions</li>
      </ul>
      What I’m looking for now is the right environment to sharpen my skills with purpose.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In past roles, I’ve thrived most when I had strong mentorship—someone to challenge me, give
      feedback, and help me connect the dots between what I know and how to apply it. I experienced
      this firsthand while working at a weather tech company, where thoughtful code reviews, agile
      processes, and a supportive team helped me grow more in a year than I had in several before
      it. That’s the kind of structure I’m seeking again.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I’ve also learned the hard way what doesn’t work—roles with no direction, no growth, or no
      room to ask questions. Even in those situations, I’ve stayed committed to doing great work,
      whether that meant learning SQL on my own or coming up with creative frontend solutions in a
      startup setting. Most recently, I’ve spent the last four years building client sites in a
      fully matured CMS platform. I’m proud of what I accomplished there, but I’m ready for
      something more dynamic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I want to build, learn, and contribute to something that evolves. Ideally, I’m looking for a
      team working with modern frontend technologies like React or Vue, with space to grow into
      full-stack development. More than anything, I want to be part of a company that values
      mentorship, collaboration, and constant improvement—because that’s where I do my best work.
