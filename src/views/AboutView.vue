    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve always been a problem solver—first with computers, then with customers, and now through
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into tech didn’t start in a classroom. It started when I was 12, building my first
      PC with help from a friend. What began as a way to play games turned into something bigger: I
      was theming Myspace profiles, exploring open-source tools like Foobar2000, and accidentally
      wiping my hard drive while trying to fix it through the command line. That moment—panic,
      recovery, learning—was my first real lesson in how tech works _under_ the surface. I didn’t
      know it then, but I was already on my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      My early career was in retail. I sold components and electronics at RadioShack, then moved to
      Verizon, where I found I was just as strong at solving technical issues as I was at making
      sales. I eventually focused full-time on client solutions. At the same time, I was in college
      studying automotive technology, chasing what I thought was my path—until I realized fixing
      cars felt more like a chore, while working with computers felt like home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turning point came when I was offered a role at a civil engineering firm. It wasn’t my
      field, but I loved the culture and the collaborative environment. Around then, a friend
      introduced me to a coding bootcamp at Rutgers. That’s when everything clicked. Web development
      was the thing I didn’t know I’d been preparing for all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I’ve worked across multiple teams and companies, constantly leveling up and
      expanding my skill set. What’s kept me grounded throughout is my love for figuring things
      out—whether it’s debugging code, customizing a UI, or helping a teammate understand something
      clearly. Communication has always been my edge, and tech became the space where I could
      combine that with real, creative problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>I'm still learning. Still building. Still curious. That hasn’t changed.</p>
