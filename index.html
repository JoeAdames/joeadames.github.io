      <div class="display-1 text-center mb-4">What I'm Looking For</div>
      <div class="row align-items-center justify-content-evenly">
        <p class="fs-3">I see myself as early in my career, but not inexperienced. I’ve worked on client-facing applications, contributed to real products, and learned how to deliver practical solutions. What I’m looking for now is the right environment to sharpen my skills with purpose.</p>

        <p class="fs-3">In past roles, I’ve thrived most when I had strong mentorship—someone to challenge me, give feedback, and help me connect the dots between what I know and how to apply it. I experienced this firsthand while working at a weather tech company, where thoughtful code reviews, agile processes, and a supportive team helped me grow more in a year than I had in several before it. That’s the kind of structure I’m seeking again.</p>

        <p class="fs-3">I’ve also learned the hard way what doesn’t work—roles with no direction, no growth, or no room to ask questions. Even in those situations, I’ve stayed committed to doing great work, whether that meant learning SQL on my own or coming up with creative frontend solutions in a startup setting. Most recently, I’ve spent the last four years building client sites in a fully matured CMS platform. I’m proud of what I accomplished there, but I’m ready for something more dynamic.</p>
        <p class="fs-3">I want to build, learn, and contribute to something that evolves. More than anything, I want to be part of a company that values mentorship, collaboration, and constant improvement—because that’s where I do my best work.</p>
        <div class="display-1 text-center mb-4"> In The Meantime</div>
        <p class="fs-3">I am working on security practices and getting certified in cybersecurity. I’m drawn to cybersecurity because it’s fast-paced, team-driven, and requires sharp thinking under pressure. I enjoy solving problems and working with others to protect what matters. With strengths in programming and collaboration, I focus on securing workflows and building smarter, stronger systems. My goal is to help any organization stay ahead by understanding their tools, learning from past vulnerabilities, and strengthening their overall defenses.</p>
        <p class="fs-3">My goal is to apply my programming skills in the cybersecurity field. A solid understanding of how the web works gives me a clear edge. With languages like JavaScript, PHP, and Python, I can automate tasks, test security defenses, streamline workflows, and generate reports. Knowing how the web operates—and where it’s vulnerable—is key to becoming an effective Security Analyst.</p>
